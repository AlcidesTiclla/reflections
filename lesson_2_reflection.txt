How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	it is an area to commit something that you have ready to commit, the working area does not consider using the
	repository so if you want to have  your changes in to a git repository you have to stage it using git add <file>

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	runnig git diff to see the change that I have done 

		
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	it would help to sabe status of development and many of test
	it also will work very well to develop simultaniusly

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	that abstraction helps understand about how git commit exactly works, I guess the data extrucure used to do it is a three. so I do not have any problem undestanting it.
